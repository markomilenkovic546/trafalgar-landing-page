# Trafalgar Landing Page

Through the development of this project, I focused on practicing HTML structuring and CSS styling.
Please note that the page layout and styling have been designed for desktop viewports only.

## Design

The page design was created using Figma.
You can find the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/EWmzcVkd7qbP5Nf7iMvuqP/Trafalgar-Landing-Page?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=GzAdWF3ym7AsWoP9-0). 
It serves as a reference for the visual representation and layout of the landing page.

## Dependencies

- Swiper library: The Swiper library is used to develop the slider functionality on the page.
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run the project using a Live Server to view the landing page.
